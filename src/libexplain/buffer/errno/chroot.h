/**
  * The explain_buffer_errno_chroot function is used to obtain an
  * explanation of an error returned by the <i>chroot</i>(2) system call.
  * The least the message will contain is the value of
  * <tt>strerror(errnum)</tt>, but usually it will do much better, and
  * indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
  *
  * @param sb
  *     The string buffer to print the message into. If a suitable buffer
  *     is specified, this function is thread safe.
  * @param errnum
  *     The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the errno
  *     global variable just before this function is called. This is
  *     necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system
  *     call to be explained and this function, because many libc functions
  *     will alter the value of errno.
  * @param pathname
  *     The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <i>chroot</i>(2)
  *     system call.
