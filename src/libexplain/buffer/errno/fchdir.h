/**
  * The explain_buffer_errno_fchdir function is used to obtain an
  * explanation of an error returned by the fchdir(2) system call.  The
  * least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but
  * usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in
  * more detail.
  *
  * @param sb
  *     The string buffer in which the message is being constructed.
  *     If a safe buffer is specified, this function is thread safe.
  * @param errnum
  *     The error value to be decoded, usually obtain from the errno
  *     global variable just before this function is called.  This
  *     is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the
  *     system call to be explained and this function, because many libc
  *     functions will alter the value of errno.
  * @param fildes
  *     The original fildes, exactly has passed to the fchdir(2) system call.
