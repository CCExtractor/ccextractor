//! Provide types for storing time in different formats
//!
//! Time can be represented in one of following formats:
//! - [`Timestamp`] as number of milliseconds
//! - [`MpegClockTick`] as number of clock ticks (as defined in the MPEG standard)
//! - [`FrameCount`] as number of frames
//! - [`GopTimeCode`] as a GOP time code (as defined in the MPEG standard)
