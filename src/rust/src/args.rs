Originally based on McPoodle's tools. Check his page for lots of information
on closed captions technical details.
(http://www.theneitherworld.com/mcpoodle/SCC_TOOLS/DOCS/SCC_TOOLS.HTML)

This tool home page:
http://www.ccextractor.org
  Extracts closed captions and teletext subtitles from video streams.
    (DVB, .TS, ReplayTV 4000 and 5000, dvr-ms, bttv, Tivo, Dish Network,
     .mp4, HDHomeRun are known to work).

  Syntax:
  ccextractor [options] inputfile1 [inputfile2...] [-o outputfilename]
")]
#[command(
    help_template = "{name} {version}, {author}.\n{about}\n {all-args} {tab}\n
An example command for burned-in subtitle extraction is as follows:
ccextractor video.mp4 --hardsubx --subcolor white --detect_italics --whiteness_thresh 90 --conf_thresh 60

Notes on File name related options:
  You can pass as many input files as you need. They will be processed in order.
  If a file name is suffixed by +, ccextractor will try to follow a numerical
  sequence. For example, DVD001.VOB+ means DVD001.VOB, DVD002.VOB and so on
  until there are no more files.
  Output will be one single file (either raw or srt). Use this if you made your
  recording in several cuts (to skip commercials for example) but you want one
  subtitle file with contiguous timing.

Notes on Options that affect what will be processed:
  In general, if you want English subtitles you don't need to use these options
  as they are broadcast in field 1, channel 1. If you want the second language
  (usually Spanish) you may need to try -2, or -cc2, or both.

Notes on Levenshtein distance:
  When processing teletext files CCExtractor tries to correct typos by
  comparing consecutive lines. If line N+1 is almost identical to line N except
  for minor changes (plus next characters) then it assumes that line N that a
  typo that was corrected in N+1. This is currently implemented in teletext
  because it's where samples files that could benefit from this were available.
  You can adjust, or disable, the algorithm settings with the following
  parameters.

Notes on times:
  --startat and --endat times are used first, then -delay.
  So if you use --srt -startat 3:00 --endat 5:00 --delay 120000, ccextractor will
  generate a .srt file, with only data from 3:00 to 5:00 in the input file(s)
  and then add that (huge) delay, which would make the final file start at
  5:00 and end at 7:00.

Notes on codec options:
  If codec type is not selected then first elementary stream suitable for 
  subtitle is selected, please consider --teletext -noteletext override this
  option.
  no-codec and codec parameter must not be same if found to be same 
  then parameter of no-codec is ignored, this flag should be passed 
  once, more then one are not supported yet and last parameter would 
  taken in consideration

Notes on adding credits:
  CCExtractor can _try_ to add a custom message (for credits for example) at
  the start and end of the file, looking for a window where there are no
  captions. If there is no such window, then no text will be added.
  The start window must be between the times given and must have enough time
  to display the message for at least the specified time.

Notes on the CEA-708 decoder:
  While it is starting to be useful, it's
  a work in progress. A number of things don't work yet in the decoder
  itself, and many of the auxiliary tools (case conversion to name one)
  won't do anything yet. Feel free to submit samples that cause problems
  and feature requests.

Notes on spupng output format:
  One .xml file is created per output field. A set of .png files are created in
  a directory with the same base name as the corresponding .xml file(s), but with
  a .d extension. Each .png file will contain an image representing one caption
  and named subNNNN.png, starting with sub0000.png.
  For example, the command:
    ccextractor --out=spupng input.mpg
  will create the files:
    input.xml
    input.d/sub0000.png
    input.d/sub0001.png
    ...
  The command:
    ccextractor --out=spupng -o /tmp/output --output-field both input.mpg
  will create the files:
    /tmp/output_1.xml
    /tmp/output_1.d/sub0000.png
    /tmp/output_1.d/sub0001.png
    ...
    /tmp/output_2.xml
    /tmp/output_2.d/sub0000.png
    /tmp/output_2.d/sub0001.png
    ..."
