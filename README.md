CCExtractor is a tool used to produce subtitles for TV recordings from almost anywhere in the world. We intend to keep up with all sources and formats.

Subtitles are important for many people. If you're learning a new language, subtitles are a great way to learn it from movies or TV shows. If you are hard of hearing, subtitles can help you better understand what's happening on the screen. We aim to make it easy to generate subtitles by using the command line tool or Windows GUI.

The official repository is ([CCExtractor/ccextractor](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor)) and master being the most stable branch.

### **Features**

- Extract subtitles in real-time
- Translate subtitles
- Extract closed captions from DVDs
- Convert closed captions to subtitles

### Programming Languages & Technologies

The core functionality is written in C. Other languages used include C++ and Python.

<p align="center">
  CCExtractor is participating in Google Code-in 2018!
</p>

Google Code-In is a global, online open source development & outreach contest for pre-university students aged between 13-17. Participants complete “tasks” ranging from coding, documentation, quality assurance, design, outreach and research to earn t-shirts, digital certificates, and hooded sweatshirts for their work. Grand prize winners receive a four day trip to Google in Mountain View, CA, USA the following summer!

We have a long and proud history of taking part in the Google Summer of Code with university students, and are excited to participate in GCI again for 3rd year with pre-university students!

Sounds interesting? Read more about it on our website [here](https://ccextractor.org/public:codein:google_code-in_2018) and on the official website [here](https://codein.withgoogle.com/).
