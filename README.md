# CCExtractor

CCExtractor is a free, GPL licensed closed caption tool that everyone who produces subtitles from TV uses. It is a tool that analyzes video files and produces independent subtitle files from the closed captions data. CCExtractor supports Linux, Windows, and OSX platforms. With so many different formats this is always a moving target, and we intend to keep up with all sources and formats. We aim to provide global accessibility (all users, all contents, all countries) for this software package.

Carlos' version (mainstream) is the most stable branch as of date.
