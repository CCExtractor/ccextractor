# CCExtractor

CCExtractor is a tool that produces subtitles from TV use. Global accessibility (all users, all content, all countries) is the goal. With so many different formats, this is a constantly moving target, but we intend to keep up with all sources and formats.

Carlos' version (mainstream) is the most stable branch.

## Google Summer of Code 2017
CCExtractor has been invited to Summer of Code 2017! Another summer of coding fun.

If you are a student currently enrolled in university most likely you are eligible to participate. Read more at:  
- [Google Summer of Code official website ](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
- [CCExtractor's main GSoC page](https://www.ccextractor.org?id=public:gsoc:ideas_page_for_summer_of_code_2017)


## Installation and Usage

Downloads for precompiled binaries and source code can be found [on our website](https://www.ccextractor.org?id=public:general:downloads).

Extracting subtitles is relatively simple. Just run the following command:

```ccextractor <input>```

This will extract the subtitles.
