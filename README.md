# CCExtractor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CCExtractor/ccextractor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CCExtractor/ccextractor)

CCExtractor is a tool that produces subtitles from TV use. Global accessibility (all users, all content, all countries) is the goal. With so many different formats, this is a constantly moving target, but we intend to keep up with all sources and formats.

This is the offical repo of CCExtractor and master being the most stable branch. It is (mainly) maintained by Carlos ([cfsmp3](https://github.com/cfsmp3)).

## Google Code-in 2017
CCExtractor is participating in Google Code-in 2017! 

Google Code-In is a competition of encouraging young people to learn more about Open Source and contributing to it. Tasks range from coding, documentation, quality assurance, user interface, outreach and research 

This is our second year of challenging tasks for students in elementary and high school aged 13-17.
