# CCExtractor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CCExtractor/ccextractor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CCExtractor/ccextractor)

CCExtractor is a tool that produces subtitles from TV use. Global accessibility (all users, all content, all countries) is the goal. With so many different formats, this is a constantly moving target, but we intend to keep up with all sources and formats.

The official repository ([CCExtractor/ccextractor](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor)) is the most stable branch. It is (mainly) maintained by Carlos ([cfsmp3](https://github.com/cfsmp3)).

## Google Code-in 2017
CCExtractor has been invited to Code-in 2017! A second year of challenging tasks for students aged 13-17.

If you are a student fitting the age criteria, then you most likely are eligible to participate. Read more at the [Google Code-in website](https://codein.withgoogle.com).

## Installation and Usage
