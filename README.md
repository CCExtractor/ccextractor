# CCExtractor

CCExtractor is a tool that produces subtitles from TV use. Global accessibility (all users, all content, all countries) is the goal. With so many different formats, this is a constantly moving target, but we intend to keep up with all sources and formats.

Carlos' version (mainstream) is the most stable branch.

## Installation and Usage

Downloads for precompiled binaries and source code can be found [on our website](http://www.ccextractor.org/doku.php?id=public:general:downloads).

Extracting subtitles is relatively simple. Just run the following command:

```ccextractor <input>```

This will extract the subtitles. 

More usage information can be found on our website:

- [Using the command line tool](http://www.ccextractor.org/doku.php?id=public:general:command_line_usage)
- [Using the Windows GUI](http://www.ccextractor.org/doku.php?id=public:general:win_gui_usage) 

## Compiling

Compilation instructions are coming soon. 

## Support

By far the best way to get support is by opening a support ticket at our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/issues). 

When creating a ticket:

- Make sure you are using the latest CCExtractor version.
- If it's a new issue (for example a video file that a previous CCExtractor version processed fine but now causes a crash), mention the last version you know was working.
- If the issue is about a specific file, make that file available for us. Don't just send us the output from CCExtractor, as we can't do anything about a screenshot that shows a crash. We need the input that actually causes it. You can upload the file to Dropbox, Google Drive, etc, and make it public so you get a download link to add to your ticket.
- If you cannot make the file public for any (reasonable) reason you can send us a private invitation (both Dropbox and Google Drive allow that). In this case we will download the file and upload it to the private developer repository.
- Do not upload your file to any location that will require us to sign up or endure a wait list, slow downloads, etc.
- If your upload expires make sure you keep it active somehow (replace links if needed). Keep in mind that while we go over all tickets some may take a few days, and it's important we have the file available when we actually need it.
- Make sure you set an alert in GitHub so you get notifications about your ticket. We may need to ask questions and we do everything inside GitHub's system.
- Please use English. 
- It goes without saying, we like polite people.

You can also [contact us by email or chat with the team in Slack](http://www.ccextractor.org/doku.php?id=public:general:support).
