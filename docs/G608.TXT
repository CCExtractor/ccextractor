G608
====
G608 (for grid 608) is generated by CCExtractor by using -out=g608.

This is a verbose format that exports the contents of the 608 grid verbatim
so there's no loss of positioning or colors due the limitations or complexity
or other output formats.

G608 is a text file with a structure based on .srt and looks like this:

For each subtitle frame there's exactly 15 rows (which represent the 15 rows of the 608 screen)
of 96 characters each.

Each row is divided in 3 blocks: 32 characters for the text, 32 characters for the color, and 
32 characters for the font. 

The possible color values are:
	COL_WHITE = 0,
	COL_GREEN = 1,
	COL_BLUE = 2,
	COL_CYAN = 3,
	COL_RED = 4,
	COL_YELLOW = 5,
	COL_MAGENTA = 6,
	COL_USERDEFINED = 7,
	COL_BLACK = 8,
	COL_TRANSPARENT = 9
	
And the possible font values are:
    R => Regular
    I => Italics
    U => Underlined
    B => Underlined + Italics

If a 'E' is found in either color or font that means a bug in CCExtractor. Should you ever get
an E please send us a .bin file that causes it.
	
This format is intended for post processing tools that need to represent the output of a 608
decoder accurately but that don't want to deal with the madness of other more generic subtitle
formats.
