For building CCExtractor using cmake follow steps below..

Step 1) Check you have right version of cmake installed. ( version >= 3.0.2 )
	We are using CMP0037 policy of cmake which was introduced in 3.0.0
	since we have tested our system only with cmake version 3.0.2, I would
	suggest to use 3.0.2 or higher version.


Step 2) create a separate directory where you want to build the target.
	In Unix you can do it using following commands.
	~> cd ccextractor
	~> mkdir build

Step 3) make the build system using cmake
	~> cmake ../src/

Step 4) Compile the code.
	~> make
	~> make install

Step 5) Use CCextractor as you would like


If you want to build CCExtractor with FFMpeg you need to pass
cmake -DWITH_FFMPEG=ON ../src/

If you want to build CCExtractor with OCR you need to pass
cmake -DWITH_OCR=ON ../src/

If you want to build CCExtractor with Sharing and Translating service:
cmake -DWITH_SHARING ../src/

Hint for looking all the things you want to set from outside
cmake -LAH ../src/
