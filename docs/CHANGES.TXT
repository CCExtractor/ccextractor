0.77
----
- Fixed bug in capitalization code ('I' was not being capitalized).
- GUI should now run in Windows 8 (using the include .Net runtime, since
  3.5 cannot be installed in Windows 8 apparently).
- Fixed Mac build script, binary is now compiled with support for
  files over 2 GB.
- Fixed bug in PMT code, damaged PMT sections could make CCExtractor
  crash.

0.76 (2015-03-28)
-----------------
- Added basic M2TS support
- Added EPG support - you can now export the Program Guide to XML
- Some bugfixes

0.75 (2015-01-15)
-----------------
- Fixed issue with teletext to other then srt.
- CCExtractor can be used as library if compiled using cmake
- By default the Windows version adds BOM to generated UTF files (this is
  because it's needed to open the files correctly) while all other
  builds don't add it (because it messes with text processing tools). 
  You can use -bom and -nobom to change the behaviour.

0.74 (2014-09-24)
-----------------
- Fixed issue with -o1 -o2 and -12 parameters (where it would write output only in the o2 file)
- Fixed UCLA parameter issue. Now the UCLA parameter settings can't be overwritten anymore by later parameters that affect the custom transcript
- Switched order around for TLT and TT page number in custom transcript to match UCLA settings
- Added nobom parameter, for when files are processed by tools that can't handle the BOM. If using this, files might be not readable under windows.
- Segfault fix when no input files were given
- No more bin output when sending to server + possibility to send TT to server for processing
- Windows: Added the Microsoft redistributable MSVCR120.DLL to both the installation package and the application zip.

0.73 - GSOC (2014-08-19)
------------------------
- Added support of BIN format for Teletext
- Added start of librarisation. This will allow in the future for other programs to use encoder/decoder functions and more.

0.72 - GSOC (2014-08-12)
------------------------
- Fix for WTV files with incorrect timing
- Added support for fps change using data from AVC video track in a H264 TS file.
- Added FFMpeg Support to enable all encapsulator and decoder provided by ffmpeg

0.71 - GSOC (2014-07-31)
------------------------
- Added feature to receive captions in BIN format according to CCExtractor's own
  protocol over TCP (-tcp port [-tcppassword password])
- Added ability to send captions to the server described above or to the
  online repository (-sendto host[:port])
- Added -stdin parameter for reading input stream from standard input
- Compilation in Cygwin using linux/Makefile
- Fix for .bin files when not using latin1 charset
- Correction of mp4 timing, when one timestamp points timing of two atom

0.70 - GSOC (2014-07-06)
------------------------
This is the first release that is part of Google's Summer of Code.
Anshul, Ruslan and Willem joined CCExtractor to work on a number of things
over the summer, and their work is already reaching the mainstream 
version of CCExtractor.

- Added a huge dictionary submitted by Matt Stockard.
- Added DVB subtitles decoder, spupng in output
- Added support for cdt2 media atoms in QT video files. Now multiple atoms in
 a single sample sequence are supported.
- Changed Makefile.
- Fixed some bugs.
- Added feature to print info about file's subtitles and streams (-out=report).
- Support Long PMT.
- Support Configuration file.
	- There is an sample configuration file in doc/ folder with name
	  ccextractor.cnf.sample
	- Just now only ccextractor.cnf named files kept beside ccextractor
	  executable is supported
	- for details of which options can be set using configuration file,
	  please look at sample file.

- Added options for custom transcript output:
	new parameter (-customtxt format), where the format must be like this: 1100100 (7 digits).
	These indicate whether the next things should be displayed  or not in the (timed) transcript:
		- Display start time
		- Display end time
		- Display caption mode
		- Display caption channel
		- Use a relative timestamp ( relative to the sample)
		- Display XDS info
		- Use colors
	Examples:
		0000101 is the default setting for transcripts
		1110101 is the default for timed transcripts
		1111001 is the default setting for -ucla
	Make sure you use this parameter after others that might affect these 
	settings (-out, -ucla, -xds, -txt, -ttxt, ...)
- Fixed Negative timing Bug

0.69 (2014-04-05)
-----------------
- A few patches from Christopher Small, including proper support
  for multiple multicast clients listening on the same port.
- GUI: Fixed teletext preview.
- GUI: Added a small indicator of data being received when reading from
  UDP.
- GUI: Added UTF-8 support to preview Window (used for teletext).
- Fixes in Makefile and build script, compilation in linux and OSX failed
  if another libpng was found in the system.
- WTV support directly in CCExtractor (no need for wtvccdump any more).
- Started refactoring and clean-up.
- Fix: MPEG clock rollover (happens each 26 hours) caused a time
  discontinuity.
- Windows GUI: Started work on HDHomeRun support. For now it just looks 
  for HDHomeRun devices. Lots of other things will arrive in the next
  versions.
- Windows GUI: Some code refactoring, since the HDHomeRun support makes
  the code larger enough to require more than one source file :-)

0.68 (2013-12-24)
-----------------
- A couple of shared variables between 608 decoders were causing
  problems when both fields were processed at the same time with
  -12, fixed.
- Added BOM for UTF-8 files.
- Corrected a few extended characters in the UTF-8 encoding,
  probably never used in real world captioning but since we got
  a good test sample file...
- Color and fonts in PAC commands were ignored, fixed (Helen Buus).
- Added a new output format, spupng. It consists on one .png file
  for each subtitle frame and one .xml with all the timing 
  (Heleen Buus).
- Some fixes (Chris Small).

0.67 (2013-10-09)
-----------------
- Padding bytes were being discarded early in the process in 0.66,
  which is convenient for debugging, but it messes with timing in
  .raw, which depends on padding. Fixed.
- MythTV's branch had a fixed size buffer that could not be enough
  some times. Made dynamic.
- Better support for PAT changing mid stream.
- Removed quotes in Start in .smi (format fix).
- Added multicast support (Chris Small)
- Added ability to select IP address to bind in UDP (Chris Small)
- Fixes in -unixts and -delay for teletext.
- Added -autodash : When two people are talking, add a dash as
  needed (this is based on subtitle position). Only in .srt and
  with -trim. Quite experimental, feedback appreciated.
- Added -latin1 to select Latin 1 as encoding. Default is now
  UTF-8 (-utf8 still exists but it's not needed).
- Added -ru1, which emulates a (non-existing in real life) 1 line
  roll-up mode. 


0.66 (2013-07-01)
-----------------
- Fixed bug in auto detection code that triggered a message 
  about file being auto of sync.
- Added -investigate_packets
  The PMT is used to select the most promising elementary stream
  to get captions from. Sometimes captions are where you least
  expect it so -datapid allows you to select a elementary stream
  manually, in case the CC location is not obvious from the PMT
  contents. To assist looking for the right stream, the parameter
  "-investigate_packets" will have CCExtractor look inside each
  stream, looking for CC markers, and report the streams that 
  are likely to contain CC data even if it can't be determined from
  their PMT entry.
- Added -datastreamtype to manually selecting a stream based on
  its type instead of its PID. Useful if your recording program
  always hides the caption under the stream stream type. 
- Added -streamtype so if an elementary stream is selected manually
  for processing the streamtype can be selected too. This can be 
  needed if you process for example a stream that is declared as 
  "private MPEG" in the PMT, so CCExtractor can't tell what it is.
  Usually you'll want -streamtype 2 (MPEG video) or -streamtype 6
  (MPEG private data).
- PMT content listing improved, it now shows the stream type for
  more types.
- Fixes in roll-up, cursor was being moved to column 1 if a 
  RU2, RU3 or RU4 was received even if already in roll-up mode.
- Added -autoprogram. If a multiprogram TS is processed and 
  -autoprogram is used CCExtractor will analyze all PMTs and use
  the first program that has a suitable data stream.
- Timed transcript (ttxt) now also exports the caption mode 
  (roll-up, paint-on, etc) next to each line, as it's useful to 
  detect things like commercials.
- Content Advisory information from XDS is now decoded if it's
  transmitted in "US TV parental guidelines" or "MPA". 
  Other encoding such as Canada's are not supported yet due 
  to lack of samples.
- Copy Management information from XDS is now decoded.
- Added -xds. If present and export format is timed transcript
  (only), XDS information will be saved to file (same file as the
  transcript, with XDS being clearly marked). Note that for now
  all XDS data is exported even if it doesn't change, so the 
  transcript file will be significantly larger.
- Added some PaintOn support, at least enough to prevent it 
  from breaking things when the other modes are used.
- Removed afd_data() warning. AFD doesn't carry any caption related
  data. AFD still detected in code in case we want to do something
  with it later anyway.
- Ported last changes from Petr Kutalek's telxcc. Current version
  is 2.4.4.
- In teletext mode when exporting to transcript (not .srt), an effort
  is made to detect and merge line duplicates. This is done by using
  the Levenshtein's distance, which is the number of changes requires
  to convert one string to another. To simplify things, strings are
  compared up to the length of the shortest one.
  There are 3 parameters that can be used to tweak the thresholds:
      -deblev: Enable debug so the calculated distance for each two
	   strings is displayed. The output includes both strings, the
	   calculated distance, the maximum allowed distance, and whether
	   the strings are ultimately considered equivalent or not, i.e.
	   the calculated distance is less or equal than the max allowed.
	  -levdistmincnt value: Minimum distance we always allow 
	   regardless of the length of the strings. Default 2. This means 
	   that if the calculated distance is 0, 1 or 2, we consider the 
	   strings to be equivalent.
	  -levdistmaxpct value: Maximum distance we allow, as a 
	   percentage of the shortest string length. Default 10%. For 
	   example, consider a comparison of one string of 30 characters 
	   and one of 60 characters. We want to determine whether the 
	   first 30 characters of the longer string are more or less the 
	   same as the shortest string, i.e. whether the longest string 
	   is the shortest one plus new characters and maybe some 
	   corrections. Since the shortest string is 30 characters and 
	   the default percentage is 10%, we would allow a distance of 
	   up to 3 between the first 30 characters.
- Added -lf : Use UNIX line terminator (LF) instead of Windows (CRLF).	   
- Added -noautotimeref: Prevent UTC reference from being auto set from
  the stream data.

0.65 (2013-03-14)
-----------------
- Minor GUI changes for teletext
- Added end timestamps in timed transcripts
- Added support for SMPTE (patch by John Kemp)
- Initial support for MPEG2 video tracks inside MP4 files (thanks a
  lot to GPAC's Jean who assisted in analyzing the sample and 
  doing the required changes in GPAC).
- Improved MP4 auto detection
- Support for PCR if PTS is not available (needed for some teletext
  samples, and probably useful for everything else).
- Support for UDP streaming - finally. Use "-udp $port" to have
  CCExtractor listen for a stream. I've only been able to test it
  with an European HDHomeRun, but it should work fine with any other
  tuner.
- Refactored PMT / PAT processing in transport streams, now allows to
  display their contents (-parsePAT and -parsePMT) which makes
  troubleshooting easier.
  
0.64 (2012-10-29)
-----------------
- Changed Window GUI size (larger).
- Added Teletext options to GUI.
- Added -teletext to force teletext mode even if not detected
- Added -noteletext to disable teletext detection. This can be needed
  for streams that have both 608 data and teletext packets if you
  need to process the 608 data (if teletext is detected it will
  take precedence otherwise).
- Added -datapid to force a specific elementary stream to be used for
  data (bypassing detections).
- Added -ru2 and -ru3 to limit the number of visible lines in roll-up
  captions (bypassing whatever the broadcast says).
- Added support for a .hex (hexadecimal) dump of data. 
- Added support for wtv in Windows. This is done by using a new program
  (wtvccdump.exe) and a new DirectShow filter (CCExtractorDump.dll) that
  process the .wtv using DirecShow's filters and export the line 21 data
  to a .hex file. The GUI calls wtvccdump.exe as needed.
- Added --nogoptime to force PTS timing even when CCExtractor would
  use GOP timing otherwise.

0.63 (2012-08-17)
-----------------
- Telext support added, by integrating Petr Kutalek's telxcc. Integration is
  still quite basic (there's equivalent code from both CCExtractor and 
  telxcc) and some clean up is needed, but it works. Petr has announced that 
  he's abandoning telxcc so further development will happen directly in 
  CCExtractor.
- Some bug fixes, as usual.

0.62 (2012-05-23)
-----------------
- Corrected Mac build "script" (needed to add GPAC includes). Thanks to the
  Mac users that sent this.
- Hauppauge mode now uses PES timing, needed for files that don't have
  caption data during all the video (such as in commercial breaks).
- Added -mp4 and -in:mp4 to force the input to be processed as MP4. 
- CC608 data embedded in a separate stream (as opposed as in the video
  stream itself) in MP4 files is now supported (not heavily tested). 
  This should be rather useful since closed captioned files from iTunes
  use this format.
- More CEA-708 work. The debugger is now able to dump the "TV" contents for
  the first time. Also, a .srt can be generated, however timing is not quite 
  good yet (still need to figure out why). 
- Added -svc (or --service) to select the CEA-708 services to be processed.
  For example, -svc 1,2 will process the primary and secondary language
  services. Valid values are 1-63, where 1 is the primary language, 2 is
  the secondary language (this is part of the specification) and 3-63 are
  provider defined.
- Rajesh Hingorani sent a fix for the MPEG decoder that fixes garbled output
  or certain samples (we had none like this in our test collection). Thanks,
  Rajesh.

0.61 (2012-03-08)
-----------------
- Fix: GCC 3.4.4 can now build CCExtractor.
- Fix: Damaged TS packets (those that come with 'error in transport' bit
  on) are now skipped.
- Fix: Part of the changes for MP4 support (CC packets buffering in 
  particular) broke some stuff for other files, causing at least very 
  annoying character duplication. We hope we've fixed it without breaking 
  anything but please report).
- Some non-interesting cleanup.

0.60 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Add: MP4 support, using GPAC (a media library). Integration is currently
  "enough so it works", but needs some more work. There's some duplicate
  code, the stream must be a file (no streaming), etc.
- Fix: The Windows version was writing text files with double \r.
- Fix: Closed captions blocks with no data could cause a crash.
- Fix: -noru (to generate files without duplicate lines in 
  roll-up) was broken, with complete lines being missing.
- Fix: bin format not working as input. 

0.59 (2011-10-07)
-----------------
- More AVC/H.264 work. pic_order_cnt_type != 0 will be processed now. 
- Fix: Roll-up captions with interruptions for Text (with ResumeTextDisplay
  in the middle of the caption data) were missing complete lines.
- Added a timed text transcript output format, probably only useful for
  roll-up captions. Use --timedtranscript or -ttxt. Output is like this:

00:01:25,485 | HOST: LAST NIGHT THE REPUBLICAN
00:01:29,522 | HOPEFULS INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO
00:01:30,623 | PRIMARY VOTERS.

- XDS parser. Not complete (no point in dealing with V-Chip stuff for
  example), but enough to extract program and station information.
- Input streams can now come from standard input using - (just an hyphen)
  as parameter.
- Added a new output format called 'null' (use -null or -out=null). This
  format means "Don't produce any file", and is useful to have CCExtractor
  process the stream (for XDS messages, debugging, etc) without actually
  generating anything.
- Updated Windows GUI.
- Added -quiet => If used, CCExtractor will not write any message.
- Added -stdout => If used, the captions will be sent to stdout (console)
  instead of file. Combined with -, CCExtractor can work as a filter in
  a larger process, receiving the stream from stdin and sending the
  captions to stdout. 
- Some code clean up, minor refactoring.
- Teletext detection (not yet processing).

0.58 (2011-08-21)
-----------------
- Implemented new PTS based mode to order the caption information
  of AVC/H.264 data streams.  The old pic_order_cnt_lsb based method
  is still available via the -poc or --usepicorder command switches.
- Removed a couple of those annoying "Impossible!" error messages 
  that appears when processing some (possibly broken, unsure) files.
- Added -nots --notypesettings to prevent italics and underline 
  codes from being displayed.
- Note to those not liking the paragraph symbol being used for the 
  music note: Submit a VALID replacement in latin-1.
- Added preliminary support for multiple program TS files. The 
  parameter --program-number (or -pn) will let you choose which
  program number to process. If no number is passed and the TS 
  file contains more than one, CCExtractor will display a list of
  found programs and terminate.
- Added support (basic, because I only received one sample) for some
  Hauppauge cards that save CC data in their own format. Use the
  parameter -haup to enable it (CCExtractor will display a notice 
  if it thinks that it's processing a Hauppauge capture anyway).
- Fixed bug in roll-up.
- More AVC work, now TS files from echostar that provided garbled
  output are processed OK.
- Updated Windows GUI.

0.57 (2010-12-16)
-----------------
- Bugfixes in the Windows version. Some debug code was unintentionally
  left in the released version. 

0.56 (2010-12-09)
-----------------
- H264 support
- Other minor changes a lot less important

0.55 (2009-08-09)
-----------------
- Replace pattern matching code with improved parser for MPEG-2 elementary
  streams.
- Fix parsing of ReplayTV 5000 captions.
- Add ability to decode SCTE 20 encoded captions.
- Make decoding of TS files more error tolerant.
- Start implementation of EIA-708 decoding (not active yet).
- Add -gt / --goptime switch to use GOP timing instead of PTS timing.
- Start implementation of AVC/H.264 decoding (not active yet).
- Fixed: The basic problem is that when 24fps movie film gets converted to 30fps NTSC 
  they repeat every 4th frame. Some pics have 3 fields of CC data with field 3 CC data 
  belongs to the same channel as field 1. The following pics have the fields reversed 
  because of the odd number of fields. I used top_field_first to tell when the channels 
  are reversed. See Table 6-1 of the SCTE 20 [Paul Fernquist]

0.54 (2009-04-16)
-----------------
- Add -nosync and -fullbin switches for debugging purposes.
- Remove -lg (--largegops) switch.
- Improve syncronization of captions for source files with
  jumps in their time information or gaps in the caption
  information.
- [R. Abarca] Changed Mac script, it now compiles/link 
  everything from the /src directory. 
- It's now possible to have CCExtractor add credits 
  automatically.
- Added a feature to add start and end messages (for credits).
  See help screen for details.

0.53 (2009-02-24)
-----------------
- Force generated RCWT files to have the same length as source file.
- Fix documentation for -startat / -endat switches.
- Make -startat / -endat work with all output formats.
- Fix sync check for raw/rcwt files.
- Improve timing of dvr-ms NTSC captions.
- Add -in=bin switch to read CCExtractor's own binary format.
- Fix problem with short input files (smaller 1MB).
- Clean up regular and debug output.
- Add -out=bin switch to write RCWT data.
- Remove -bo/--bufferoutput switch and functionality.
- [Volker] Added new generic binary format (RCWT
  for Raw Captions With Time). This new format
  allows one file to contain all the available
  closed caption data instead of just one stream.
- Added --no_progress_bar to disable status 
  information (mostly used when debugging, as the
  progress information is annoying in the middle
  of debug logs).
- The Windows GUI was reported to freeze in some 
  conditions. Fixed.
- The Windows GUI is now targeted for .NET 2.0 
  instead of 3.5. This allows Windows 2000 to run
  it (there's not .NET 3.5 for Windows 2000), as
  requested by a couple of key users.

0.51 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Removed -autopad and -goppad, no longer needed.
- In preparation to a new binary format we have 
  renamed the current .bin to .raw. Raw files 
  have only CC data (with no header, timing, etc).
- The input file format (when forced) is now
  specified with 
    	-in=format
  such as -in=ts, -in=raw, -in=ps ...
  The old switches (-ts, -ps, etc) still work.
  The only exception is -bin which has been removed
  (reserved for the new binary format). Use
  -in=raw to process a raw file. 
- Removed -d, which when produced a raw file used
  a DVD format. This has been merged into a new
  output type "dvdraw". So now instead of using
  -raw -d as before, use -out=dvdraw if you need
  this.
- Removed --noff
- Added gui_mode_reports for frontend communications,
  see related file.
- Windows GUI rewritten. Source code now included, 
  too.
- [Volker] Dish Network clean-up

0.50 (2008-12-12)
-----------------
- [Volker] Fix in DVR-MS NTSC timing
- [Volker] More clean-up
- Minor fixes

0.49 (2008-12-10)
-----------------
- [Volker] Major MPEG parser rework. Code much
  cleaner now. 
- Some stations transmit broken roll-up captions,
  and for some reason don't send CRs but RUs...
  Added work-around code to make captions readable.
- Started work on EIA-708 (DTV). Right now you can
  add -debug-708 to get a dump of the 708 data. 
  An actually useful decoder will come soon.
- Some of the changes MIGHT HAVE BROKEN MythTV's
  code. I don't use MythTV myself so I rely on
  other people's samples and reports. If MythTV
  is broken please let me know.
- Added new debug options.
- [Volker] Added support for DVR-MS NTSC files.
- Other minor bugfixes and changes.

0.46 (2008-11-24)
-----------------
- Added support for live streaming, ccextractor
  can now process files that are being recorded
  at the same time.
  
- [Volker] Added a new DVR-MS loop - this is 
  completely new, DVR-MS specific code, so we no
  longer use the generic MPEG code for DVR-MS. 
  DVR-MS should (or will be eventually at least)
  be as reliable as TS.
  Note: For now, it's only ATSC recordings, not
  NTSC (analog) recordings.

0.45 (2008-11-14)
-----------------
- Added autodetection of DVR-MS files.
- Added -asf to force DVR-MS mode.
- Added some specific support for DVR-MS
  files. These format used to work
  correcty in 0.34 (pure luck) but the
  MPEG code rework broke it. It should
  work as it used to.
- Updated Windows GUI to support the
  new options.
- Added      -lg --largegops
  From the help screen:
  Each Group-of-Picture comes with timing 
  information. When this info is too separate 
  (for example because there are a lot of 
  frames in a GOP) ccextractor may prefer not 
  to use GOP timing. Use this option is you 
  need ccextractor to use GOP timing in large
  GOPs.

0.44 (2008-09-10)
-----------------
- Added an option to the GUI to process
  individual files in batch, i.e. call
  ccextractor once per file. Use it if you
  want to process several unrelated files
  in one go.
- Added an option to prevent duplicate
  lines in roll-up captions.
- Several minor bugfixes.
- Updated the GUI to add the new options.

0.43 (2008-06-20)
-----------------
- Fixed a bug in the read loop (no less)
  that caused some files to fail when 
  reading without buffering (which is 
  the default in the linux build).
- Several improvements in the GUI, such as
  saving current options as default.

0.42 (2008-06-17)
-----------------
- The option switch "-transcript" has been
  changed to "--transcript". Also, "-txt"
  has been added as the short alias.
- Windows GUI
- Updated help screen

0.41 (2008-06-15)
-----------------
- Default output is now .srt instead of .bin,
  use -raw if you need the data dump instead of
  .srt. 
- Added -trim, which removes blank spaces at 
  the left and rights of each line in .srt.
  Note that those spaces are there to help
  deaf people know if the person talking is
  at the left or the right of the screen, i.e.
  there aren't useless. But if they annoy
  you go ahead...

0.40 (2008-05-20)
-----------------
- Fixed a bug in the sanity check function 
  that caused the Myth branch to abort. 
- Fixed the OSX build script, it needed a
  new #define to work.

0.39 (2008-05-11)
-----------------
- Added a -transcript. If used, the output will
  have no time information. Also, if in roll-up
  mode there will be no repeated lines.
- Lots of changes in the MPEG parser, most of
  them submitted by Volker Quetschke. 
- Fixed a bug in the CC decoder that could cause
  the first line not to be cleared in roll-up
  mode. 
- ccextractor can now follow number sequences in
  file names, by suffixing the name with +.
  For example,
  
  DVD0001.VOB+ 

  means DVD0001.VOB, DVD0002.VOB, etc. This works
  for all files, so part001.ts+ does what you
  could expect.
- Added -90090 which changes the clock frequency
  from the MPEG standard 90000 to 90090. It 
  *could* (remains to be seen) help if there are
  timing issues. 
- Better support for Tivo files.
- By default ccextractor now considers the whole
  input file list a one large file, instead of
  several, independent, video files. This has
  been changed because most programs (for example
  DVDDecrypt) just cut the files by size. 
  If you need the old behaviour (because you 
  actually edited the video files and want to
  join the subs), use -ve.


0.36 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Fixed bug in SMI, nbsp was missing a ;.
- Footer for SAMI files was incorrect (<body> and
  <sami> tags were being opened again instead of
  being closed).
- Displayed memory is now written to disk at end
  of stream even if there is no command requesting
  so (may prevent losing the last screenful).
- Important change that could break scripts, but
  that have been added because old behaviour was
  annoying to most people: _1 and _2 at the end
  of the output file names is now added ONLY if
  -12 is used (ie when there are two output 
  files to produce). So

  ccextractor -srt sopranos.mpg

  now produces sopranos.srt instead of sopranos_1.srt.
  If you use -12, i.e.

  ccextractor -srt -12 sopranos.mpg

  You get

  sopranos_1.srt and
  sopranos_2.srt

  as usual.


0.35 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Added --defaultcolor to the help screen. Code
  was already in 0.34 but the documentation wasn't
  updated.
- Buffer is larger now, since I've found a sample
  where 256 Kb isn't enough for a PES (go figure).
- At the end of the process, a ratio between
  video length and time to process is displayed.

0.34 (2007-06-03)
-----------------
- Added some basic letter case and capitalization
  support. For captions that broadcast in ALL
  UPPERCASE (most of them), ccextractor can now
  do the first part of the job.

  --sentencecap or -sc will tell ccextractor to
  follow the typical capitalization rules, such
  as capitalize months, days of week, etc.

  So from
             YOU BETTER RESPECT
             THIS ROBE, ALAN

  You get

             You better respect
             this robe, alan.

  --capfile or -caf also enables the case
  processing part and adds an extra list of
  words in the specified file, for example:

  --capfile names.txt

  where names.txt is just a plain text file
  with the proper spelling for some words,
  such as
  
  Alan
  Tony

  So you get 

             You better respect
             this robe, Alan.

  Which is the correct spelling. You can
  have a different spelling file per TV
  show, or a large file with a lot of
  words, etc.
- ccextractor has been reported to 
  compile and run on Mac with a minor
  change in the build script, so I've
  created a mac directory with the
  modified script. I haven't tested it
  myself.
- Windows build comes with a File Version
  Number (0.0.0.34 in this version) in case
  you want to check for version info.

0.33 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Added -scr or --screenfuls, to select the
  number of screenfuls ccextractor should
  write before exiting. A screenful is 
  a change of screen contents caused by
  a CC command (not new characters). In
  practice, this means that for .srt each
  group of lines is a screenful, except when
  using -dru (which produces a lot of 
  groups of lines because each new character
  produces a new group).
- Completed tables for all encodings.
- Fixed bug in .srt related to milliseconds
  in time lines. 
- Font colors are back for .srt (apparently
  some programs do support them after all).
  Use -nofc or --nofontcolor if you don't
  want these tags.

0.32 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Added -delay ms, which adds (or substracts)
  a number of milliseconds to all times in 
  .srt/.sami files. For example,
  
         -delay 400

  causes all subtitles to appear 400 ms later
  than they would normally do, and

         -delay -400

  causes all substitles to appear 400 ms before
  they would normally do.
- Added -startat at -endat which lets you
  select just a portion of data to be processed,
  such as from minute 3 to minute 5. Check
  help screen for exact syntax.

0.31 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Added -dru (direct rollup), which causes
  roll-up captions to be written as
  they would on TV instead of line by line.
  This makes .srt/.sami files a lot longer,
  and ugly too (each line is written many
  times, two characters at time).

0.30 (2007-05-24)
-----------------
- Fix in extended char decoding, I wasn't
  replacing the previous char.
- When a sequence code was found before
  having a PTS, reported time was 
  undefined. 

0.29 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Minor bugfix.

0.28 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Fixed a buffering related issue. Short version,
  the first 2 Mb in non-TS mode were being
  discarded.
- .srt no longer has <font> tags. No player
  seems to process them so my guess is that
  they are not part of the .srt "standard"
  even if McPoodle add them.

0.27 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Modified sanitizing code, it's less aggresive
  now. Ideally it should mean that characters
  won't be missed anymore. We'll see.

0.26 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Added -gp (or -goppad) to make ccextractor use
  GOP timing. Try it for non TS files where 
  subs start OK but desync as the video advances.

0.25 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Format detection is not perfect yet. I've added
  -nomyth to prevent the MytvTV code path to be
  called. I've seen apparently correct files that
  make MythTV's MPEG decoder to choke. So, if it
  doesn't work correctly automatically: Try 
  -nomyth and -myth. Hopefully one of the two
  options will work.


0.24 (unreleased)
-----------------
- Fixed a bug that caused dvr-ms (Windows Media Center)
  files to be incorrectly processed (letters out of
  order all the time).
- Reworked input buffer code, faster now.
- Completed MythTV's MPEG decoder for Program Streams,
  which results in better processing of some specific
  files. 
- Automatic file format detection for all kind of
  files and closed caption storage method. No need to
  tell ccextractor anything about your file (but you
  still can).


0.22 (2007-05-15)
-----------------
- Added text mode handling into decoder, which gets rids 
  of junk when text mode data is present.
- Added support for certain (possibly non standard
  compliant) DVDs that add more captions block in a 
  user data block than they should (such as Red October).
- Fix in roll-up init code that caused the previous popup
  captions not to be written to disk.
- Other Minor bug fixes.


0.20 (2007-05-07)
-----------------
- Unicode should be decent now.
- Added support for Hauppauge PVR 250 cards, and (possibly)
  many others (bttv) with the same closed caption recording 
  format.
  This is the result of hacking MythTV's MPEG parser into
  ccextractor. Integration is not very good (to put it
  midly) but it seems to work. Depending on the feedback I
  may continue working on this or just leave it 'as it'
  (good enough). 
  If you want to process a file generated by one of these
  analog cards, use -myth. This is essential as it will
  make the program take a totally different code path.
- Added .SAMI generation. I'm sure this can be improved,
  though. If you have a good CSS for .SAMI files let me
  know.

0.19 (2007-05-03)
-----------------
- Work on Dish Network streams, timing was completely broken. 
  It's fixed now at least for the samples I have, if it's not
  completely fixed let me know. Credit for this goes to
  Jack Ha who sent me a couple of samples and a first 
  implementation of a semiworking fix.
- Added support for several input files (see help screen for
  details).
- Added Unicode and Latin-1 encoding.
  

0.17 (2007-04-29)
-----------------
- Extraction to .srt is almost complete - works correctly for
  pop-up and roll-up captions, possibly not yet for paint-on
  (mostly because I don't have any sample with paint-on captions
  so I can't test).
- Minor bug fixes.
- Automatic TS/non-TS mode detection.

0.14 (2007-04-25)
-----------------
- Work on handling special cases related to the MPEG reference
  clock: Roll over, jumps, etc.
- Modified padding code a bit: In particular, padding occurs
  on B-Frames now.
- Started work on CC data parsing (use -608 to see output).
- Added built-in input buffering.
- Major code reorganization.
- Added a decent progress indicator.
- Added TS header synchronization (so the input file no longer
  needs to start with a TS header).
- Minor bug fixes.

0.07 (2007-04-19)
-----------------
- Added MPEG reference clock parsing.
- Added autopadding in TS. Does miracles with timing.
- Added video information (as extracted from sequence header).
- Some code clean-up.
- FF sanity check enabled by default.
