A mailing list is now available from sourceforge:

https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ccextractor-users

I expect it to be very low traffic (right now there's around 10
people actively helping with ccextractor in one way or
another), so almost everything goes here:

- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Announcements

NOT here:

- Samples
