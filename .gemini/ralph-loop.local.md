Mission: Verify and finalize DVB Splitting logic. ITERATE UNTIL 100% SUCCESS on all criteria: valid subs, correct splitting, no crashes, repetition, and perfect timestamps. Workflow (Strict Sequence - REPEAT AS NEEDED): 1. /superpowers:ultra_think: Analyze DVB_SPLIT_BUG_REPORT.md and current code state. Identify ALL potential failure modes. 2. /superpowers:ultra_strategise: Develop/Refine a comprehensive test suite covering File Splitting, Content Validity, Zero Repetition, Timestamp Integrity, Stability, Legacy Safety. 3. /superpowers:sharingan: Implement fixes and improvements. CRITICAL: If a previous attempt failed, REFACTOR the approach. 4. /superpowers:detect_kill: Execute the full test suite. DECISION POINT: IF ANY ERROR: FAIL. Loop back. IF 100% PASS: Proceed to write. 5. /superpowers:write: Generate DVB_SPLIT_VERIFICATION_FINAL.md. Constraint: DO NOT output the completion promise until the entire test suite passes without a single warning or error.
