<h1>Compilation guide</h1>
<h4>*First of all you have to have your visual studio installed on your computer.</h4>

<p>When you already have visual studio you have to download ccextractor code <a href="https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/">CCExtractor</a></p>
  
<p>After downloading open your CCExtractor folder and then open windows folder.</p>
<br>
<h4>Here you can see two files .vcxproj(marked with blue arrows) and one .sln project(marked with a red arrow)</h4>

<br>

<p>You have to open .sln if you want to build both non Gui and Gui ccextractor or you can build them seperately opening .vcxproj files one by one.</p>

<br>

<h4>Further, if you receive a confirmation request about downloading from unsafe resource just click OK and go forward</h4>
