<h1>Compilation guide</h1>
<h4>*First of all you have to have your visual studio installed on your computer.</h4>

<p>When you already have visual studio you have to download ccextractor code <a href="https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/">CCExtractor</a></p>
  
<p>After downloading open your CCExtractor folder and then open windows folder.</p>
<br>
<p>Here you can see two files .vcxproj(marked with blue arrows) and one .sln project(marked with a red arrow)</p>

<p>You have to open .sln if you want to build both non Gui and Gui ccextractor or you can build them seperate opening .vcxproj files one by one.</p>
